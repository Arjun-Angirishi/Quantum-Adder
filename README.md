# Building a basic Quantum Adder using Toffoli Gates

This repository contains implementation of Adder circuit using Toffoli Gates (CCNOT) amd CNOT gates. The Adder Circuits include single bit full adder and 4 bit full adder.

## Problem Statement

Alice wishes to perform the addition of two 4-bit numbers using Quantum Circuits. Let those two numbers be a and b. In classical digital electronics, this is achieved using the full-adder circuit, which inputs the bits a_i,b_i and carry bit C_(i-1) and returns the sum bit S_i and carry bit C_i. Hence, the result of the computation would be as follows: Your task is to help Alice design a fully functional Quantum Adder using just CNOT and Toffoli Gates.
